<h1>Hi There ðŸ‘‹</h1>
<p>Oculit is a student-led organization which aims to provide advanced platforms & applications to the global community. Based on variety of skills, we contribute to development in artificial intelligence and online platforms. That's exactly why we are <i>Unbounded Developers</i>. We do not define our limits but rather challenge rigorous tasks to improve and make a step forward in development.<br/><br/>Our organization mainly develops platforms for the global community, but we also conduct projects within out school community, too. In fact, our organization has a subsidiary club in our school, which is the <a href="https://github.com/sja-dev">SJA AI Development Club</a>. The SJA AI Development Club is dedicated for the development in artificial intelligence, and some of the exemplary members are also a part of Oculit.<br/><br/>In Oculit, all members will perform their limitless creativity and push their best effort to form a secure workspace, where everybody could contribute to the society with free visions and skill performance.</p>
